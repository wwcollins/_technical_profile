I am excited to apply for the Director of Engineering position at CharterUP. As an experienced engineering leader with over 15 years of progressive executive experience, I believe my skills and talent align perfectly with the responsibilities and requirements of this position described in your job description.

I have a strong background in building and managing software engineering teams as well as delivering complex hybrid and SaaS-based applications. My extensive experience in cloud operations, including Azure, AWS, Google (GCP), and more, makes me confident in my ability to scale and secure systems for your organization's needs. As a leader, I have experience managing teams utilizing modern programming languages, data structures & algorithms, frameworks, APIs, services, and Agile/Scrum processes. Additionally, my experience leading internationally located development teams in various countries has taught me how to align business and technical management effectively.

I have successfully managed product development teams by translating product feature requirements into prioritized technical deliverables to meet or exceed deadlines. Through my leadership and automation of weekly KPI generation, I have consistently improved matrixed communication, process efficiencies, investment in key talent and supporting systems. My strong people and communication skills, coupled with my ability to present complex information to technical and non-technical audiences, contribute to my ability to build, mentor, and motivate high-performance teams of individuals to work together and deliver industry-leading results.

As the Director of Engineering at CharterUP, I am confident in my ability to drive alignment towards critical objectives, prioritize and sequence team efforts, mentor and grow teams of software engineers, devops engineers, data engineers, and QA, and work alongside the CTO, VP of Product Management, and customer stakeholders to deliver customer facing and back-office software systems.

I am excited about CharterUP's mission to revolutionize the fragmented $15 billion charter bus industry through innovation, and I would be honored to contribute to this mission as your Director of Engineering.
